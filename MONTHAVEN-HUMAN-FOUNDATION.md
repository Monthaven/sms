## THE PROVEN TEMPLATE (20k+ texts validated)
```
Hi, reaching out about {StreetAddress}. Still open to offers, or has that ship sailed? - {caller_name}, Monthaven Capital
```

## WHY THIS WORKS
- **Human tone**: "If I could grab your attention for just a minute that would be awesome"
- **Respectful approach**: Gives them an easy out ("has that ship sailed")  
- **One clear ask**: Simple yes/no decision
- **Professional close**: Company name builds credibility
- **Conversational**: Sounds like a person, not a robot

## RESPONSE CLASSIFICATIONS (Keep Simple)
- **HOT**: "Make an offer", "Call me", "Yes, interested" → Call within 5 minutes
- **WARM**: "Maybe", "Depends on price", "How much" → Call within 24-48 hours  
- **COLD**: "Not interested", "Not now", No response → Follow up in 14-21 days
- **OPT-OUT**: "Stop", "Remove me", "Wrong number" → Never contact again

## GOLDEN RULES
1. **One message at a time** - No double-texting until timer expires or they respond
2. **Respect the "No"** - If they say not interested, honor it
3. **Build relationships** - Focus on connection over transaction
4. **Stay human** - Cool, level-headed, professional but personal
5. **Track everything** - Learn from what works and what doesn't
