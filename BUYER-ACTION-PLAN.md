```
"Hi John, this is [Your Name]. I sent you a text about your office building on Main Street. I'm a cash buyer - I've closed on 3 commercial properties this year, all cash, typically 30 days or less.

I've done some preliminary analysis on your property and I'm thinking we could be in the $2.6M to $3.0M range, all cash, quick close. No brokers involved, so you'd keep that 6% commission in your pocket - that's about $200K more in your pocket.

Do you have 10 minutes to discuss what it would take for you to consider selling?"
